            <h1> Genres </h1>
            <p> A genre is a category that a book can be put into. There are many different genres of books. Below are some examples
                of genres. It is important to pick a book from a specific genre that you find interesting to ensure you will enjoy the book. </p>

            <ol>
                <li> <strong>Mystery</strong>: These books are written at a fast pace and have some case that needs to be solved. The reader
                                tries to solve the mystery along with the characters, making him/her feel as though he/she is also
                                in the world of the book. This genre helps develop observation skills as the reader learns to pay attention
                                to little details that may help solve the case. </li>
                <li> <strong>Non-fiction</strong>: This genre is more informational as it contains events that are realistic. A biography, for example, is a non-fiction novel.
                                    However, some of these novels have stories that are not based on true events, but they can still occur. Basically, there are
                                    no flying humans or singing turtles. All the events could possibly happen, even if they haven't happened yet.</li>
                <li> <strong>Horror</strong>: These books are written with the intent to scare the reader, similar to horror films. They may be completely unrealistic
                                with dreadful monsters, or it could be more psychologically frightening. Lots of descriptions ae given to help the reader
                                visualize the scenes and monsters. This is usually liked by people who enjoy horror films, where the horror is not too extreme
                                that the person stops watching/reading, but enough for them to get scared but still want to keep going. </li>
                <li> <strong>Fantasy</strong>: Magic. Wonderland. New Realms. This genre is completely unrealistic, but that's what makes it so fun! The characters can fly, use magic,
                                go on crazy adventures to different worlds, and do whatever the author's imagination could think of. These books are a great escape from
                                the real world that may get boring and overwhelming at times. The reader can live out their best fantasies in these wonderfully described worlds
                                with characters that seem so real. </li>
                <li> <strong>Science Fiction</strong>: This genre creates futuristic worlds based on how technology is advancing. Things like time-travel are completely normal
                                        in sci-fi novels. The characters live in a world that is similar to the real world, but have inventions that, although are
                                        not real, may one day be real based on the advancements of scientific knowledge and technology.</li>
